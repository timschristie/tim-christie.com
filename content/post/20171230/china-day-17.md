Ate a quick breakfast this morning at the same nearby Hangzhou-style local restaurant we ate at last night. On the way back to the hotel we passed a fruit store, and brought 2 freshly squeezed orange juices for ¥33, and some apples.

Checked out of the hotel, and caught the metro to 客运中心 where we transferred to a long distance bus station. Brought some tickets to Xitangzhen (西塘镇), but the next available seats were on a bus which departed in 2 hours.

We decided to eat lunch at a restaurant just outside the bus centre, and then had a coffee at a Starbucks which was next door. Got back to the station just a short while before the bus arrived.

It took about 2 and a half hours to reach Xitangzhen, when we arrived it was still quite overcast and just lightly raining. We walked down the road to the Xitang Holiday Hotel and checked in.
