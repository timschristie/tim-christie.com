Ate rice noodles for breakfast, and for lunch stir-fry tofu and vegetables. Went out to explore Juzhou Park in the afternoon. The park exists on an island in the middle of the Xiangjiang River (connected to the adjacent shorelines by a large bridge).

The island is about 6km long in total, we walked up and down a 2km stretch of this passing a number of interesting sights on the way.

Of particular interest was a collection of metal sculptures in one corner of the park.

We ended up at the southern tip of the island, where there stands an enormous 32 metre high Mao Zedong sculpture.
