Ate blue corn and an egg for breakfast. Went out afterwards and caught a bus to the Hunan Martyr's Park, Changsha's largest park.

Saw the monument at the top of the hill, and walked around the side of a lake inside the park.

Afterwards, we walked to a nearby restaurant and ate a traditional Hunan style lunch.

Following lunch, we walked to the Hunan Provincial Museum and took a look around inside (no photos allowed).

Took the bus back, and ate pork buns and rice soup for dinner.
