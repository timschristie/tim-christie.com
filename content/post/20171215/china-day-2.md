Woke up and ate at the buffet breakfast in the hotel. Proceeded to head out and search for a China Unicom store to get some SIM cards. Was unable to find one so returned. Left the hotel as they could not renew the room, and moved to the Meijing Hotel in the Minzhi Residential District.

Walked to the Shenzhen North Railway Station. Arrived at the West Square, walked around to the East Square and found some lunch. Proceeded to find a China Unicom store, and got a SIM card sorted.

Took the metro to Shenzhen Bay Park. Walked around for a while and looked across the bay to Hong Kong.

After a while, walked over to the other side of the road and found a fountain and a bar street. Entered a nearby plaza to find and ATM. Got some cash out and took the train back to the hotel.

Walked out into the local community to find dinner. Found a really nice Changsha-style rice noodle shop. Afterwards, continued exploring the area; brought some mandarins from a fruit shop, and some Harbin beer from a small convenience shop.

Returned to the hotel and went to sleep.
