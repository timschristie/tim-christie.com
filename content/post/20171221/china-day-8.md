At wontons for breakfast this morning. Booked some train tickets for our trip to Beijing tomorrow, and went to collect them from the Changsha South Railway Station via the city metro. There was quite a long queue so we had to wait for a while - but it was good to avoid having to do this tomorrow morning instead.

Afterwards, returned via metro to Yingwanzhen Station - and found lunch in a nearby fast food restaurant on Lushan Road. We ate rice noodles, and I also had a pork baozi.

We then continued on foot towards the Yeu Lu Mountain, and entered via Xinmin Road.

We started to walk up the mountain but as we were pressed for time decided to get a bus up to the top. It turned out to be a good idea as the ride up was rather long.

At the top there was a very good panoramic view of the city skyline.

We ate a quick snack of some stir-fried fermented tofu, and then got back on the bus which took us down the other side of the mountain.

We disembarked at Aiwan (Autumn-Admiring) Pavilion, and took a stroll around the pond and up towards to the pavilion.

Continuing of from there, we walked down towards the city - passing through the Hunan University precinct, before catching a bus back.

Ate stir-fried vegetables, tofu, and meat for dinner.
