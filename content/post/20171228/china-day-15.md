The night on the overnight coach went quickly enough, woke up early and recharged our phones (limited charging stations available). Brought some rice soup and mantou for breakfast on the train.

Arrived at 9am sharp. Disembarked at Hangzhou Railway Station, and took the metro from Chengzhan to Ding'an Road. Walked the rest of the way to the Merchant Marco Edgelake Hotel (Jiangjun Rd).

After checking in, we walked out to eat a proper breakfast at Kui Yuan Guan (奎元馆) on Jiefang Rd.

Once we had finished eating, we walked back down Jiefang Rd towards Yigongyuan Park, where we then proceeded to walk south around the West Lake.

Eventually circled back towards the city, and grabbed lunch at a local food resturant. We continued on, passing through the Qinghefang Special History and Culture Street District, where we brought some special tea cookies.

We then arrived at the Huxueyan Former Residence, and spent some time wandering around the reconstructed building and gardens.

After finishing up there, we walked back to the hotel and made a cup to tea to have with the cookies we brought earlier in the day.
