Got up and ate a quick breakfast at a rice noodle shop just down the road from the hotel, then visited a nearby cinema to watch the 2017 film "Youth".

I thought the cinematography was rather good, and the story was entertaining. Luckily for me they ran it with English subtitles.

After the movie, we ate lunch in a Pizza Hut restaurant. The food was unlike what I am used to, but was an interesting experience none the less.

Made a trip to the bank next, to try and figure out how to get something working that was causing issues.

Went back to the hotel room afterwards to recharge our phones.
