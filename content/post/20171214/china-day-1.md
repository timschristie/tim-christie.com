Boarded Hainan Airlines flight HU412 in Brisbane at 11:30am, and departed at approximately 12pm. Arrived in Shenzhen at roughly 6:10pm (local time). Taxi drived took the "scenic route" to the hotel, however we called him out and paid a fair price for the trip. Spent the night in the Vienna Hotel, Shenzhen North Technological Park.
