I will be attempting to keep a travel log during our trip to China this year. This will likely be notes taken on-the-fly,and thus will be ordinarily kept quite brief.

We boarded Hainan Airlines flight HU412 in Brisbane at 11:00am, and departed at approximately 11:30am. Arrived in Shenzhen about 8 hours and 40 minutes later at roughly 6:10pm (local time).

Taxi drived took the "scenic route" to the hotel, however we called him out and paid a fair price for the trip.

Spent the night at the Vienna Hotel, Shenzhen North Technological Park.
