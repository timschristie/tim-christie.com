Decided it was time to update this site. It's still hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), but is now using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

So far so good. I've opted to use the [Cactus Theme by digitalcraftsman](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-cactus-theme), which has made setting this up a breeze.
