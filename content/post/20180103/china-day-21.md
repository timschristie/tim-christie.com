description: "Travelling back to Changsha"

Had breakfast at the same place again this morning, then checked out of the hotel and caught a taxi to the Hangzhou Railway Station to catch a high speed train back to Changsha.

The trip to Changsha took about 4 hours. After arriving, we took the metro to Wuyi Square and transferred to a bus to take us back to Yinpenling Residential District. We are staying at a different hotel this time, just a block down the road from the one we were at last time.

Ate dumplings for dinner, and had an early night.
