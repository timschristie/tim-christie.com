I decided to spend some time updating my website over the weekend. Usually this would mean jumping on my [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) machine &mdash; however, I decided it would be a good chance to give [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) a go and see how far I could get.

To my surprise, this went remarkably well. 

With access to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about), and the [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) package repositories (via `apt-get`), I had no issues at all downloading and configuring any of the software I needed to work on this site.

This included:

* Installing `vim` (unfortunately not Version 8)
* Installing `git` (works a bit better than [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com) on Windows)
* Generating SSH keys
* Installing `golang`
* Downloading & installing the [latest Hugo deb package](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases)

I am looking forward to using this more in the coming weeks; first impressions &mdash; this is an excellent addition to Windows.
