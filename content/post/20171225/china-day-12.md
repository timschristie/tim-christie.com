Ate breakfast at the same nearby fast food restaurant we went to for dinner at last night. It was pretty cold outside, a temperature of 5 degrees Celsius is the forecast maximum.

Renewed the hotel booking for another night, and caught up on a few things in the hotel room..

Today we decided to go and take a look at a proper hutong. Walked to the nearby metro station (Anhuaqiao), and travelled to the Nanlouguxiang hutong.

It was a rather long hutong, and we spent a while walking along the street looking at many shops of interest along the way.

Found a food court and brought a few dishes to try.

After eating we continued walking along the huton, and then stopped for afternoon tea at a Zarah coffee shop. The food there was somewhat underwhelming, so we moved on soon afterwards.

We started heading in the direction of the lakes near Houhai Park, but did not end up reaching it in the end. Picked up some Mr. Bao buns on the way. Saw the Drum Tower and Bell Tower though, and then took the metro back to the hotel as it was too cold to keep walking outside without warmer clothes.

Stopped in a nearby supermarket on the way and got some water to take back to the hotel.

Went out for dinner a bit later on at the Shuguo Yanyi Sichuan-style restaurant.
