Walked back into the local community area to find breakfast at a small Wonton shop. Went back to the Meijing Hotel afterwards and renewed the room for another night. Walked to the Hongshan metro station & then back to the hotel. Ate a room service rice noodle meal for lunch. Took the metro in the afternoon to Lianhua North, and walked over to the Lianhaushan Park. Spend some time looking around, climbed to the peak to see a 6-metre statue of Deng Xiaoping and a good view of the city. Decended down towards the lake area, and the left the park to find Book City. Arrived at the mall, watched an old gentleman playing a musical instument. Walked around for a while and then found a place to sit and have a drink (mango + passionfruit). Shortly after, ate dinner at a hotpot restaurant. Continued exploring the mall afterwards, doing some window shopping and browsed through the music section. Finished the evening there, taking the metro back to the hotel.
